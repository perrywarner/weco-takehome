# [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) integration

I use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing APIs in isolation (without worrying about what's going on in the browser).

The collection of requests I'm using for testing is located in this directory at "src\test\WECO Takehome.postman_collection.json". Feel free to play with them by [getting Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/) and then [Importing the Collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-data-into-postman)!
